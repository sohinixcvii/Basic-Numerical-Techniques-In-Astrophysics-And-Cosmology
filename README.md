# Some-Example-Problems-in-Python
This is a collection of my solutions to several simple Python problems that can be solved to become more familiar with the language. Please check out the README file for more details.
# Guide to the repository:
I am attaching a .txt file in this repository that contains all the questions. Anyone interested in learning Python should try to write codes  to solve these problems themselves before checking the solutions. 
# Packages and setup used:
I am using a simple Anaconda setup for my Python needs. My environment of choice is Spyder. You can also use JupyterNotebook or Google Colab with equal efficiency. 
I also use Atom for the actual coding if you want a separate text editor for a better experience.
Other than these, I have used NumPy, matplotlib and random packages, which are usually available with all standard Python installations.
