# Some-Example-Problems-in-Python
This is a collection of my solutions to several simple Python problems that can be solved to become more familiar with the language.
# Problems solved:
I am attaching a .pdf file in this repository that contains all the questions. Anyone interested in learning Python should try to write codes to solve these problems themselves before checking the solutions. 
# Packages and setup used:
You may use any python setup to write or run these codes.
My setup:  
IDE: Spyder([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))  
Code editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)
