# Basic numerical techniques for astrophysics and cosmology (compiled by Dr Suman Majumdar and Dr Bhargav Vaidya)
This is a collection of my solutions to the attached problem set. Please note that the problems were compiled by [Dr Suman Majumdar](http://people.iiti.ac.in/~sumanm/) and [Dr Bhargav Vaidya](https://www.iiti.ac.in/people/~bvaidya/).  
I am attaching a .pdf file in this repository that contains all the questions. Anyone interested in learning Python should try to write codes to solve these problems themselves before checking the solutions. 
# Packages and setup used:
You may use any python setup to write or run these codes.
My setup:  
IDE: Spyder([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))  
Code editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)
